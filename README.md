# NGScloud2

NGScloud2, a major version of NGScloud, is a bioinformatic system developed to analyze data of
NGS experiments using the cloud computing services of Amazon - Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)-
that permit the access to ad hoc computing infrastructure scaled according to the complexity of
each experiment, so its costs and times can be optimized. The application provides a user-friendly
front-end to easily operate Amazon's hardware resources and to control workflows of bioinformatic
analysis of *de novo* RNA-seq, reference-based RNA-seq and functional annotation specifically oriented
to plant species. This last workflow encapsulates our standalone application TOA (https://github.com/GGFHF/TOA/)
so it can run in EC2. NScloud2 also has technical improvements as the usage of spot instance
(they can lead to significant cost savings) or the last instances types (M5, C5 and R5).

Refer to the NGScloud2-manual.pdf in the "Package" folder for installation instructions, a description of
